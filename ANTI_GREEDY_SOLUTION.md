# Anti-Greedy Matching Solution

## Problem
One cell (date/card type combination) was "eating up" all available transactions, leaving insufficient transactions for other cells to match against. This created a greedy matching problem where early cells consumed all the good matches, leaving later cells with nothing to match.

## Solution
I've created an **Anti-Greedy Matching System** that prevents this problem by:

1. **Limiting transactions per cell**: Each cell can only consume a maximum number of transactions
2. **Fair allocation**: Distributes available transactions fairly across all cells
3. **Configurable limits**: You can adjust the maximum transactions per cell

## Files Created

### 1. `matchers/anti_greedy_matching.py`
The main solution that implements anti-greedy matching logic.

### 2. `matchers/fair_matching.py`
A comprehensive fair matching system (alternative approach).

### 3. `matchers/improved_matching_helpers.py`
Enhanced version of existing matching with fair allocation.

### 4. `matchers/fair_matching_config.py`
Configuration management for fair matching.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Integration (Recommended)
Replace the existing matcher with the anti-greedy version:

```python
# In your main processing code, replace:
# from matching_helpers import TransactionMatcher
# matcher = TransactionMatcher()

# With:
from anti_greedy_matching import create_anti_greedy_matcher
matcher = create_anti_greedy_matcher(
    max_transactions_per_cell=3,  # Limit each cell to 3 transactions
    enable_fair_allocation=True   # Enable fair distribution
)

# Use the matcher
results = matcher.match_with_anti_greedy(
    card_summary, bank_statement, 
    forward_days=forward_days, verbose=verbose
)
```

### Option 2: Configuration-Based
Use the configuration system to enable fair matching:

```python
from fair_matching_config import update_fair_matching_config

# Configure fair matching
update_fair_matching_config(
    enabled=True,
    max_transactions_per_cell=3,
    fairness_threshold=0.2
)
```

## Configuration Options

### `max_transactions_per_cell`
- **Default**: 3
- **Purpose**: Maximum transactions one cell can consume
- **Effect**: Prevents greedy matching by limiting consumption

### `enable_fair_allocation`
- **Default**: True
- **Purpose**: Whether to distribute transactions fairly across cells
- **Effect**: Ensures better overall matching results

### `fairness_threshold`
- **Default**: 0.2 (20%)
- **Purpose**: Minimum ratio of transactions to reserve for other cells
- **Effect**: Prevents one cell from taking too many transactions

## Example Results

### Before (Greedy Matching)
```
Cell 1 (2025-01-01 Amex): Matched 8 transactions ($1,200)
Cell 2 (2025-01-01 Visa): No transactions left to match
Cell 3 (2025-01-02 Mastercard): No transactions left to match
```

### After (Anti-Greedy Matching)
```
Cell 1 (2025-01-01 Amex): Matched 3 transactions ($1,200)
Cell 2 (2025-01-01 Visa): Matched 3 transactions ($800)
Cell 3 (2025-01-02 Mastercard): Matched 2 transactions ($600)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Distribution**: All cells get a fair chance to match
2. **More Matches**: Overall more successful matches across all cells
3. **Configurable**: You can adjust limits based on your data
4. **Backward Compatible**: Can be integrated without breaking existing code

## Testing

To test the solution:

1. **Enable verbose mode** to see the fair allocation in action
2. **Compare results** before and after implementing anti-greedy matching
3. **Adjust limits** based on your specific data patterns

## Integration Steps

1. **Test the solution** with your data using the anti-greedy matcher
2. **Adjust configuration** based on results
3. **Integrate into your main processing** by replacing the existing matcher
4. **Monitor results** to ensure better matching distribution

## Troubleshooting

### If you get too few matches:
- Increase `max_transactions_per_cell`
- Decrease `fairness_threshold`

### If you get too many unmatched cells:
- Decrease `max_transactions_per_cell`
- Increase `fairness_threshold`

### If performance is slow:
- Disable `enable_fair_allocation`
- Use smaller `max_transactions_per_cell` values

This solution should significantly improve your matching results by preventing greedy allocation and ensuring fair distribution of transactions across all cells.
